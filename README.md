# clustering-customer-analytics-lab
Unsupervised learning and clustering projects focused on customer behavior, reviews, and retail analytics.

This repository showcases applied unsupervised machine learning projects
designed to discover hidden patterns in customer and review data.

The projects cover the complete clustering lifecycle:
- Data understanding and exploratory analysis
- Feature transformation and normalization
- Clustering using K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and density-based methods
- Cluster validation using the Elbow Method and Silhouette Analysis
- Visualization and interpretation of customer segments

The repository includes projects such as TripAdvisor review analysis,
supermarket purchase behavior analysis, e-commerce customer behavior modeling,
online retail customer segmentation, and Amazon book review analysis.

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate strong unsupervised learning
fundamentals, analytical thinking, and the ability to convert data-driven
patterns into meaningful business insights.
